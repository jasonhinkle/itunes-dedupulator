iTunes De-Dupulator
===================

iTunes De-Dupulator is a desktop app that allows you to remove duplicates from your iTunes library on Windows.

iTunes has a built-in duplicate detector which is somewhat aggressive.  It detects duplicates based only on the artist and song.  De-dupulator takes into account more aspects of the song and presents them in table where you can preview them before removing dulicates.

Features
--------

De-Dupulator looks at the length of each song to determine if the songs are actually different.  This happens with live versions of a song, remixes, alternate versions, etc.  iTunes de-dup feature will think that the live version is a duplicate because it has the same artist + song name.  Don't delete those rare live imports!

De-Dupulator does not automatically select songs for deletion if they are part of a different album.  For example, you may have one song that is on an album.  But that same song is also part of a compilation.  Although the song is technically a duplicate, when you delete it one of your albums will now be incomplete.  In this case you may wish to keep both versions so that your albums remain in-tact.
